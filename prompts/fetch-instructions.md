Grab the instructions for Day 01 through Day 12 and put them in the Markdown for that module's README

Example URLs are below.  We want everything starting from the header (e.g. `--- Day 1: Secret Entrance ---`) up until (and including) the last sentence that is always the a question and is the puzzle we are trying to solve (e.g. `What's the actual password to open the door?`).  Make the README header an H1 header (`#`) even if the HTML is not `<h1>`.

Make sure to properly format the markdown.  If the HTML has `<em>` tags, then we should bold that text.  If it has `<code>` tags, we should be putting "`" around that text.  We want our markdown to look like the instructions page
